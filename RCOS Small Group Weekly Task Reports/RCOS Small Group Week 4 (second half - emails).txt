RCOS Small Group Week 4 (2/2 emails)

These are some emails shared between Anne and I to show our communication before we ultimately had a zoom meeting to hash out ideas:

"Hi Anne,

I hope you have been doing well! We have recently gotten started on RCOS Projects and we currently have a fourth member on our team of all sophomore's working together!

I wanted to ask about ideas you might have to expand on the project's end goal beyond giving undergraduates access to a library of alumni on LinkedIn. After talking and doing research with my groupmates, the goal feels a little small and restricting. We are worried that it does not go beyond being a specified search feature for LinkedIn. Additionally, the features that we have mentioned and though out in the original plan are already used in the official LinkedIn search bar but in a general way. I was wondering if you could possibly give us inspiration on a deeper end goal for this project. 

Additionally, accessing LinkedIn's API is proving to be tricky and/or may cause money. I plan on meeting with Turner to ask about free and safe options but I wanted to check with you to see if you have any connections that might allow us to access the API database for free or access a simple web scraper to pull data off of LinkedIn's API library. Or it would be helpful if there were any possible contacts we could reach for funding.

Thank you so much for your time and your help with this project! I hope we can meet up soon!

Best Regards,
Temilolu Peters

Temi — Good to hear from you. 

Here’s the problem that we want to solve — creating a virtual networking environment between college students and alumni in related industries, geographies, etc. 

Shall we have a call on Friday to further brainstorm? I can be free at 8:30 am EST for 30 mins, or after 1:30pm EST on Friday. 

Also— how much will it cost for access to the API? 

Thanks,
Anne
